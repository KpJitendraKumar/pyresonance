Resonance
===========

Resonance is an SDN control platform that advocates event-driven network control. Resonance makes networks easier to manage by automating many tasks that are currently performed by manually modifying multiple distributed device configuration files in face of various network events, where configuration files are expressed in low-level, vendor-specific CLI commands. More information on the Resonance project can be found [here](http://resonance.noise.gatech.edu/).


PyResonance
===========

PyResonance is Resonance implemented with [Pyretic](http://frenetic-lang.org/pyretic/). Pyretic provides a better programmer-friendly environment with high-level APIs, libraries, and constructs. Pyretic's composition operators (parallel and sequential) add great value for composing modular programs.
